## Introduction to Machine Learning & AI | Individual Assignment: 93/100
## Professor Comment:
You performed excellently in your viva voce, clearly articulating your approach, demonstrating strong understanding of your methodology, and answering questions with confidence. Your submitted code base followed a logical flow of exploratory data analysis, model development, and results presentation, and reflected good programming practices throughout.
-------------
Your report on skills mismatch in the UK labour market is comprehensive and well structured. You effectively leveraged various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Means Clustering, to analyse and predict skills mismatch. The data pre-processing and feature engineering steps were clearly described, and the use of both supervised and unsupervised learning models provided valuable insights into the trends and dynamics of skills mismatch. The visualisations provided were clear and effectively supported your analysis.
To improve, enhance the discussion on hyperparameter optimisation by including more details on the selection process, such as the use of grid search versus randomised search, and the rationale behind the chosen parameters. Incorporate more varied chart types, such as radar plots to compare different demographic segments or bubble charts to show the relationship between multiple features. Ensure that all data sources are clearly cited to further support your analysis. Furthermore, discuss the explainability of models using methods like SHAP values to provide insights into feature importance and model decisions. Specify whether a parametric or non-parametric correlation method was used and justify the choice. Consider alternative training strategies to avoid overfitting, such as stratified k-fold cross-validation. Update references to include more recent peer-reviewed sources to strengthen academic rigour.
### Assignment Instructions:
Description of Assignment:

Overview: For this assignment, you will design, implement, and document a complete machine learning solution to a real-world problem by integrating concepts from across the course —from basic ML/AI definitions and data fundamentals to advanced supervised methods and model evaluation. Your submission should demonstrate your ability to select and justify a machine learning algorithm, implement and explain your code, and describe the performance improvements achieved. While you may use Python, KNIME, or Weka, please note that submissions developed in Python will be rewarded more favorably due to the emphasis on programming proficiency and code clarity. An additional bonus is available for successfully incorporating an ensemble model.

 

Assignment Instructions:

1. Problem Definition & Data Selection:

a. Choose a real-world problem (e.g., predicting housing prices, customer churn, image classification) and source a relevant dataset (not a synthetic dataset).

b. Provide context for the problem, its significance, and a brief description of the dataset.

c. Connect your problem choice to course topics, such as regression/classification, unsupervised learning, or neural networks, where applicable.

2. Algorithm Selection & Justification:

a. Evaluate at least two machine learning algorithms that could be used to solve your chosen problem.

b. Clearly justify your final selection by discussing how the chosen algorithm fits the problem requirements, insights drawn from your data, and the logic and intuition behind your decision.

3. Code Implementation & Explanation:

a. Preferred Development Environment:

i. Python is strongly encouraged.

ii. If you choose Python, please note that you may use AI tools for guidance and debugging assistance; however, the final code must be primarily your own work. If you use any AI-generated code or suggestions, document them clearly in your submission along with an explanation that demonstrates your understanding of the code.

iii. Important: Python submissions must be made using GitHub Classroom.

b. Implement your solution using your choice of tools (Python, KNIME, or Weka).

c. Ensure your code is well-structured with thorough comments and documentation.

d. Provide a detailed explanation of each key block of code, describing what it does, why it’s necessary, and how it contributes to solving the problem.

4. Performance Improvement Strategies:

a. Describe and implement techniques to enhance your model’s performance. This may include hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, randomized search), feature engineering, data wrangling, regularization, and cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

b. Explain the rationale behind these enhancements and how they improve the overall performance of your model.

5. Ensemble Model Bonus:

a. For those who choose to implement an ensemble approach (e.g., bagging, boosting, or stacking), include clear documentation of how the ensemble method was integrated into your solution and the impact it had on model performance.

6. Deliverables:

a. A comprehensive report (approximately 1,500–2,000 words) that includes:

i. An introduction to your problem and dataset.

ii. Detailed justification for your algorithm selection.

iii. A comprehensive explanation of your code (or Knime/Weka projects) and the logic behind your implementation.

iv. A clear description of the performance improvements you implemented.

v. Documentation of any ensemble techniques used (if applicable).

vi. If coded: a section detailing any AI usage in your Python code and how you ensured that the final code represents your own work.

b. Include your code or Knime/Weka projects (as an appendix or in a separate file) with sufficient comments for clarity.

c. For Python submissions: Ensure your code is submitted via GitHub Classroom.

d. A 5 minute viva voce individual presentation.
